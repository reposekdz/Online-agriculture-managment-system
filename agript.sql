(1, 'Blog', 'Raise agriculture productivity', 'The Challenge of Sustainable Agriculture\r\n\r\nThe world needs to produce at least 50% more food by 2050 to feed a projected 9 billion people. To help meet this goal, the Bank is working with countries to boost the productivity of farms, livestock and fisheries. \n\r\n\r\nThis challenge must be met against a backdrop of food price volatility and over-stretched resources, when there is less water and uncultivated land for farming and livestock, and wild capture fishery stocks are decreasing. Agriculture is also more vulnerable to climate change than any other sector: Droughts, floods and warmer temperatures reduce crop yields, and it is estimated that for every 1Â°C of global warming, grain yields will decline by 5 percent.\r\n\r\nTo raise yields sustainably, the Bank supports Climate-Smart approaches that have potential to increase productivity, enhance resilience, and lower our footprint; promotes agricultural innovation through research and education; and facilitates responsible agricultural investment.\r\n\r\nMore Crops, Livestock and Seafood\r\n\r\nThe Bank promotes innovative approaches that can help smallholders get the most out of their farms and fisheries. Gender-specific interventions are key in this area, since women account for the majority of small holder farmersâ€”up to 70% in Africa alone.\r\n\r\nThe Bank is committed to agricultural innovations that boost productivity, as well as better land and water managementâ€”US$ 1 billion was spent on irrigation and drainage in FY 2010â€“12. Watershed-management improved crop yields by up to 20 percent for Karnatakaâ€™s beneficiary farmers and higher-yielding seed varieties were piloted on selected farms in Uganda.\r\n\r\nThe Bank also promotes the use of new breeds, animal nutrition, veterinary services, vaccinations and improved husbandry, rangeland and pasture management to sustainably increase livestock productivity for about 1 billion people who depend on livestock for their livelihoods. The Bankâ€™s work on breeding and animal nutrition in India has improved the productivity of milk-giving animals. Adopting different breeds helped Assamâ€™s farmers grow their milk yields by 65 percent while better grassland management doubled the incomes of herders in Chinaâ€™s Gansu and Xinjiang regions. The Bank also supports sustainable aquaculture at coastal fisheries in Tanzania and Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThe Bank fosters long-term agricultural productivity by increasing lending to research and advisory services, as well as training farmers to apply scientific research and new knowledge to agricultural practices.\r\n\r\nSupporting an Environment that Enables Productivity\r\n\r\nThe Bank is committed to building an environment that connects farmers and fishers to the resources they need to grow their livelihoods.\r\n\r\nThis includes expanding access to financial services in countries such as Honduras so that capital can be more easily secured, using information and communications technology to improve efficiency and resolve challenges, and supporting a consumer-friendly market for fertilizers, machinery, micro-irrigation and other productivity-boosting tools.\r\n\r\nBeneficiaries include farmers in Mali who can now go to banks to seek financial products that are customized to their needs.\r\n\r\nLimited and mis-targeted public spending can constrain agricultureâ€™s potential to spur growth and reduce poverty. This is why the Bank has worked with countries such as Ethiopia, Nepal and Uganda to analyze the impacts and priorities of public spending on agriculture. With support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), the Bank is helping Sub-Saharan African countries conduct agriculture public expenditure analyses so that their governments can make better decisions on resource allocation for agriculture development.\r\n\r\nImproving Governance of Land Tenure\r\n\r\nImproved land governance can help smallholder farmers increase the productivity of their land and improve their livelihoods. The Bank supports government policies that implement systematic land surveying and titling programs that recognize all forms of land tenure.\r\n\r\nThe effective governance and use of land is important to job creation, food security, disaster risk management and mitigating the impact of climate change. Responsible private investment coupled with secure land tenure makes rural communities stronger, improves rural living conditions and boosts investment in and the efficiency of smallholder agriculture.\r\n\r\nSustainable Landscape Approaches and Climate Smart Agriculture\r\n\r\nIt is increasingly clear that agriculture, water, forests, and food security are all connected and that we need to work across all these areas to find integrated development solutions. Landscape approaches promote the sustainable and integrated use and conservation of natural resources in an equitable manner. A holistic approach in Karnataka employed watersheds to help raise water tables, brought degraded lands under cultivation, enabled farmers to diversify into higher value crops and horticulture, and raised agricultural productivity, all while improving equity between landed farmers, the landless, and women.\r\n\r\nThe Bank advocates for climate-smart agriculture, with its three core goals that together point towards a â€œtriple winâ€: increasing productivity and incomes, building resilience while reducing vulnerability, and lowering our environmental footprint.', 'download (4).jpg', 'agriculture-Maria-Fleischmann.jpg', 'improve.jpg', 'img2.jpg', 'images.jpg', 'Active'),

Now I am waiting to harvest the second season which I am sure to get more than this. says Kurwa\r\n\r\nNyaroche and other farmers in 19 villages in Bunda District has been facilitated by the project  with  support from UNDP to form productive groups for  better and easy information delivery and accessing technical assistance from the agricultural extension practitioners. They have also been provided with technical agricultural advices and inputs like certified seeds free of charge.\r\n\r\n\'Normally agricultural extension officer from the district visit us and provide education about farming methods that will help to improve  our  crops yields  and enable us  to   improve marketing of our  produce\'. Explained another farmer\r\nAfter project intervention, many farmers in project villages have formed demonstration farms, and shifted from cassava and cotton growing to sunflower and paddy growing and adopted different sustainable and modern agricultural practices eg use modern inputs seeds and fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\'Sunflower farming will help us to earn a good income because it has value. Through selling sunflower oil we will be able to get a lot of money.â€™â€™commented kurwa\r\n\r\n However the project has managed to establish agricultural information resource center in Bunda town which has helped raising awareness to farmers through agricultural films which incorporate the best farming practices by demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThrough implementation of activities, the project has managed effectively to create a functioning link between the districts Agricultural extension officers and farmers in the district which helps to improve agricultural performance.\r\n\r\nThe project has also built financial capacity of two Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies (SACCOS) by providing them with grants to enable them to extend financial services to more clients who are interested with modern agriculture. These include Kibara Biashara Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies (Tsh10, 000,000) and Mugeta SACCOS (Tsh 5,000,000).This has enabled farmers to access agricultural credits at affordable rate of interest.\r\n\r\n MAF Projects are community service oriented projects aiming to accelerate the implementation of MDG1 on reducing extreme poverty and hunger with a great emphasis on agriculture (sunflower and paddy farming) fish farming and poultry keeping.', 'images (3).jpg', 'download.jpg', 'agriculture-Maria-Fleischmann.jpg', 'images (6).jpg', 'images (12).jpg', 'Active'),
(3, 'Blog', 'Improvements on agriculture methods and productivity', 'Improvement of agricultural methods and productivity to reduce the need to cut down additional forest land. Tropical forests cannot be maintained unless agricultural productivity is greatly improved. However, to feed the projected population of the mid-21st century even at present levels, not to mention a level approaching that of developed countries, agricultural efficiencies would have to be far greater than is currently the case in most countries. We need increases in agricultural productivity of between 1.8% and 3% per year for many years. The average annual growth rate of agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1991 and 1995 was 2.4%, which must be maintained to prevent a decline in nutritional levels as populations grow (Musters, de Graaf, & ter Keurs, 2000). To provide levels of nutrition equivalent to more developed countries, still higher production growth rates will be necessary. This can occur only if technologies are greatly improved and substantial financial support is provided by wealthier countries. Without such development, conservation strategies are doomed merely by arithmetic.\r\n\r\nIt is argued that, with proper techniques, including irrigation, sustainable agriculture can be established on former rainforest soils (soybeans in the Brazilian Amazon, for example). Of course, sugar has been raised in the Caribbean and rice has been successfully cropped for thousands of years in Southeast Asia on tropical forest soils. This type of agriculture is possible where soils are fertile, as in the regions of Indonesia which have rich volcanic soils. But elsewhere, as in East Java, only the most marginal agriculture (raising tapioca and other low-nutrient tubers) is possible, and these areas are extremely poor. Some nonvolcanic rainforest areas lie on reasonably fertile soils (especially in deltas) and can sometimes sustain appropriate crops. Recently, archeologists have discovered the remains of ancient agricultural systems in the Beni region of Bolivia. These artefacts lie in seasonally-flooded savannas which have long been thought to be useful only for cattle ranching. However, the many raised agricultural fields, fish ponds and other agricultural constructions indicate that these areas have been productive in the past. Recently, the construction of similar raised fields in savanna areas in Bolivia has permitted the cultivation of tubers, maize, and manioc (Mann, 2000). If more of these areas could be converted to productive agriculture, they could provide a source of land as an alternative to rainforest removal. Often, however, governments encourage and indeed, almost coerce the development of unsuitable agricultural products, although they should not attempt to introduce non-native species and unsuitable crops or domestic animals into forest areas. For example, the Peruvian government has aggressively promoted the introduction of rice cultivation and water buffalo husbandry into many areas of the Amazon rainforest. In most places, rice is a most unsuitable cultivar, and water buffalo have caused serious erosion of riverbanks and destruction of vegetation.\r\n\r\nTo improve agricultural productivity, a number of things must be accomplished:\r\n\r\na. Reduction of the present rate of degradation and loss of productive farmland due to erosion, salinization, waterlogging, and nutrient depletion: Technologies for these purposes are available, but are little used because of the expense. However, many non-technological methods have been used for years by farmers (contour plowing, abandonment of marginal agricultural lands, planting of wind barriers, fallowing). Erosion can be prevented by the careful selection of appropriate crops, keeping ground cover on the soil, and contour plowing. Irrigation increases crop yields by about 200%, so more land must be irrigated to increase production efficiency, but this uses great quantities of water. More efficient methods must be utilized to prevent water shortages, as only 45% of irrigation water is actually absorbed by plants. Drip irrigation and other efficient delivery systems, better water distribution systems, improved control systems, and raising crops suited to the climate and soil will aid in this endeavor. Excessive or continual irrigation leads to salinization and waterlogging of the soil, which will diminish or destroy its agricultural capacity.\r\n\r\nb. Raising the crop yield on current agricultural land, as most land is not producing yields even close to the maximum possible (in part because modern technologies are not used). If the gap between current and potential yield could be bridged, the production of soybeans could be increased by 64%, that of peanuts by 208%, pulses by 472%, and cereals by 170% over a period of several years. The theoretical maximum yield for cereals is 13.4 tons per hectare, but the average cereal yield (1992-1994) was 2.77 tons per hectare â€“ not even close to this figure (Goklany, 1998). There are regional inequities as well. Yields tend to be much lower in the tropical developing countries with large, growing human populations. For instance, in Subsaharan Africa, yields of cereal grains are only one-third of the cereal yield in the northern hemisphere. Increasing yields can raise income for marginal agriculturalists and reduce dependence upon destructive slash-and-burn agricultural methods. This may be done by improving tillage methods to preserve soils and nutrients, which will be more beneficial than removing rain forest to open more agricultural land. Other techniques might include soil testing to determine soil chemistry profiles, crop rotation, nutrient and water management, terracing, instituting appropriate tillage methods for the soil/terrain, crop diversification, and interspersing crops with trees. These methods could reverse the nutrient depletion characteristic of so many cultivated soils in tropical areas. To increase productivity, one must also reduce losses from disease and pests, both during growth periods and after harvest (currently an average of 42% of crop yields is lost to these agents [Goklany, 1998]). Pest and disease-resistant varieties, better storage facilities and improved transportation could help in this, as well as the development of new high-yield crop varieties, suitable to local weather and soil conditions. Except for the â€œgreen revolutionâ€ with rice, less effort has been put into the development and study of tropical crops than temperate ones.\r\n\r\nc. Reforming agricultural practices to be less harmful to forests and forest regeneration: Among these reforms could be reductions in the use of burning, minimizing the use of toxic chemicals, and using swidden land less intensively by increasing fallow times. Zero tillage agriculture should also be utilized. When the soil is left untilled, organic matter is retained, preserving soil fertility and preventing erosion and runoff. Where the soils contain organic matter, forests can often regenerate.\r\n\r\nd. Improving the distribution of agricultural products: Distribution systems are extremely unequal in most tropical countries, and often unreliable. Access to food and other agricultural goods must be increased in terms both of availability (delivery) and affordability.\r\n\r\ne. Reduction of the environmental impacts of new technologies. To diminish environmental impacts, agricultural management systems must be devised which are suitable for specific areas and crops. This would allow reduction in artificial inputs, so that fertilizer and pesticide use could be considerably reduced.\r\n\r\nf. Reformation of policies relating to water management, allocation, and distribution. For instance, governments will frequently subsidize water use for agriculture, reducing incentives for water conservation. That users pay fairly for water is essential (now, frequently, the poor pay more for water than the rich). Many countries have achieved considerable water conservation by this method (Chile, Jordan, India and others), and it could certainly be applied by most tropical countries.\r\n\r\ng. Retention of trees as crops to protect water and soil resources. In southern Malaysia, 60% of the forested area has been kept in forest, while the other lands are used for agricultural purposes (Spears, 1988). How much of this land will remain protected with increasing demand for palm oil and other products is questionable, however.\r\n\r\nh. Development of agroforestry projects: Cash crops might be raised in small-scale agroforestry plots. Such crops as avocados, papayas, peppers, palm fruits, mangos and many other local crops are being raised in this way in the Amazon. According to Spears (1988), the need for industrial wood could be provided by tree plantations of approximately 25 million hectares, about 10% of the remaining forest area, but as of the date of the article, only 2.6 million hectares of such plantations had been established. They could preclude the need to remove virgin forest, particularly if they consist of rapidly-growing species. Such projects can act as alternatives to the expansion of agricultural areas.\r\n\r\ni. Provision of a system of tropical agricultural research stations and, especially, agricultural extension workers and soil experts to assist local farmers. This is absolutely essential for the success of agricultural reform. If farmers donâ€™t know or understand the methods, nothing can be improved.\r\n\r\nj. Provision of governmental guidance and regulation: The â€œgreen revolutionâ€ was successful and widespread only partly because of the dispersal of information to virtually all rice-growers. In addition, some coercive regulation was undertaken by governing bodies â€“ usually local â€“ in some places. In Bali, for instance, water for irrigation is provided only to those farmers who use the new varieties of rice.\r\n\r\nSome of these scenarios require that new technologies be developed, others do not. All of these changes require that economic benefits accrue to farmers to provide them with incentives for using different technologies and methods, and for using them effectively. Economic and scientific aid will be required from international agencies as well as national governmental agencies in order to assure that any changes made are sound, adapted to local conditions, and environmentally safe.', 'images (2).jpg', 'images (1).jpg', 'images (6).jpg', 'satellite.jpg', 'Pe-Boosting-Human-Capital-and-Productivity-DPF-DDO-780px.jpg', 'Active'),
(4, 'Blog', 'Sustainable Agriculture Techniques', 'Sustainable agriculture provides high yields without undermining the natural systems and resources that productivity depends on. Farmers who take a sustainable approach work efficiently with natural processes rather than ignoring or struggling against them â€“ and use the best of current knowledge and technology to avoid the unintended consequences of industrial, chemical-based agriculture. One important result is that farmers are able to minimize their use of pesticides and fertilizers, thereby saving money and protecting future productivity, as well as the environment.\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the most common sustainable agriculture techniques employed by farmers today to achieve the key goals of weed control, pest control, disease control, erosion control and high soil quality:\r\n\r\nCrop Rotation\r\nCover Crops\r\nSoil Enrichment\r\nNatural Pest Predators\r\nBiointensive Integrated Pest Management\r\nCrop Rotation\r\n\r\nCrop rotationâ€”growing different crops in succession in the same fieldâ€”is one of the most powerful techniques of sustainable agriculture, and avoids the unintended consequences of putting the same plants in the same soil year after year. It is a key element of the permanent and effective solution to pest problems because many pests have preferences for specific crops, and continuous growth of the same crop guarantees them a steady food supply, so that populations increase. For example, right now European corn borers are often a significant pest in the United States because most corn is grown in continuous cultivation or in two-year rotations with soybeans. Four- or five-year rotations would control not only corn borers, but many other corn pests as well. In fact, rotation reduces pest pressure on all the crops in the rotation by breaking the pest reproductive cycles.\r\n\r\nIn rotations, farmers can also plant crops, like soybeans and other legumes, that replenish plant nutrients, thereby reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. For instance, corn grown in a field previously used to grow soybeans needs less added nitrogen to produce high yields.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, the importance of crop rotation as a defense against pest infestations should be a key part of any discussion about growing crops for bioenergy purposes. Government policies to encourage bioenergy crops should not inadvertently encourage farmers to forgo crop rotation in favor of planting corn year after year. \r\n\r\nLearn more about crop rotation\r\n\r\nCover Crops\r\n\r\nMany farmers also take advantage of the benefits of having plants growing in the soil at all times, rather than leaving the ground bare between cropping periods, which produces unintended problems. The planting of cover crops such as hairy vetch, clover, or oats helps farmers achieve the basic goals of:\r\n\r\npreventing soil erosion,\r\nsuppressing weeds, and\r\nenhancing soil quality.\r\nUsing appropriate cover crops is worth the extra effort because it reduces the need for chemical inputs like herbicides, insecticides, and fertilizers.\r\n\r\nLearn more about cover crops\r\n\r\nSoil Enrichment\r\n\r\nSoil is arguably the single most prized element of agricultural ecosystems. Healthy soil teems with life, including many beneficial microbes and insects, but these are often killed off by the overuse of pesticides. Good soils can improve yields and produce robust crops less vulnerable to pests; abused soils often require heavy fertilizer application to produce high yields. Soil quality can be maintained and enhanced in many ways, including leaving crop residues in the field after harvest, plowing under cover crops, or adding composted plant material or animal manure.\r\n\r\nNatural Pest Predators\r\n\r\nUnderstanding a farm as an ecosystem rather than a factory offers exciting opportunities for effective pest control. For example, many birds, insects, and spiders are natural predators of agricultural pests. Managing farms so that they harbor populations of pest predators is a sophisticated and effective pest-control technique. One of the unfortunate consequences of intensive use of chemical pesticides is the indiscriminate killing of birds, bats, and other pest predators.\r\n\r\nBiointensive Integrated Pest Management\r\n\r\nOne of the most promising technologies is the control of pests through integrated pest management (IPM). This approach relies to the greatest possible extent on biological rather than chemical measures, and emphasizes the prevention of pest problems with crop rotation; the reintroduction of natural, disease-fighting microbes into plants/soil, and release of beneficial organisms that prey on the pests. Once a particular pest problem is identified, responses include the use of sterile males, biocontrol agents like ladybugs. Chemical pesticides are only used as a last resort.', 'download (3).jpg', 'images (10).jpg', 'img3.jpg', 'images (11).jpg', 'images (9).jpg', 'Active'),

He also laid out the governmentâ€™s vision of doubling the income of farmers by 2022. Shri Narendra Modi stated that for the welfare of the farmers, industries as well as the services sector were important as they offered several opportunities. The PM also urged the farmers to plant more trees and focus on animal husbandry along with traditional practices of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister mentioned that water management was also vital for the agriculture sector to flourish.

(10, 'News', 'Indian youth share smart ideas with PM using Narendra Modi App', 'The Narendra Modi Mobile App, as the one-stop destination to stay connected with the Prime Minister came into existence only some time ago, but it has contributed immensely in terms of ideas, on issues relating to youth and entrepreneurship.\r\nThe inaugural ceremony of the National Youth Festival held at Naya Raipur in Chhattisgarh, where about 6000 young participants from across the country came together, provided an occasion to Modi to express his gratitude to the youngsters for their enriching and insightful ideas shared through this interactive mobile app.\r\n    It all began on the Mann Ki Baat programme on 27 December 2015 when Modi sought ideas for the youth festival through the app. On the next day, he tweeted and shared on his Facebook page, Young friends, what are you ideas for the 2016 National Youth Festival Share your ideas with me on the Mobile App.\r\nAt the beginning of the new year, Modi took to social media to appreciate the large and diverse range of inputs through the app. He tweeted, Had sought ideas on National Youth Festival. Happy to share that the Mobile App is bustling with innovative ideas & inputs from youngsters and added, Young friends have enriched the forum with fantastic ideas on youth-led development, skill development, education, innovation & other topics.\r\nPrime Minister named certain individuals whose ideas he particularly liked. He appreciated one Girish Rathi who pitched for youngsters volunteering towards initiatives like Swachh Bharat, Make in India and Digital India. He lauded Manju for her point on imparting technical education in local languages to further youth led development. Vaibhav made some observations on drug free India, to which Modi concurred and added that sports and sportsman spirit will help mitigate the menace of drugs. The National Youth Festival incidentally does include a lot of sports activities for youngsters. The same evening he also had a brief Twitter Q A during which he deliberated with the Twitteratti on the issues raised in the morning.\r\nThe nature of inputs received clearly illustrated the aspirational zeal of the youth of India and the urge to create something new and add value to the India story.\r\nA careful scrutiny of the app illustrates that a lot of youngsters are passionate about skill development. Abhishek Manchanda wrote, Young friends have enriched the forum with fantastic ideas on youth led development, skill development, education, innovation & other topics. Dimple Anil made a suggestion, We should have capacity building workshops for our youth wherein we shall impart practical know how on social skills, emotional skills and thinking skills and even volunteered to contribute in this. Puneet Gupta expressed his views about skill development in the energy sector, Sir, we should work on skills related to solar energy, mobiles and all those things which we import most from other countries..we should also keep a close eye on an increase in demand of a particular product. Such a product might become a need for people, as in the case of the mobile phone... This way, we can develop skills in India which are new to the world and we might become exporter soon. Shardul Vikram Singh stressed on skill development and how MUDRA Yojana can benefit youngsters engaged in skill development.\r\nWhen it came to entrepreneurship, people had a lot to say about inculcating a larger spirit of entrepreneurship among the youth. Vinoth Mahadevan suggested that a spirit of enterprise be encouraged among farmers so that agricultural productivity rises. Atul Kumar echoed a similar sentiment when he wrote, Sir, we can focus on promoting farming entrepreneurship, on how to make farming a profitable business, especially with a small land holding. I myself have started a small pomegranate farm with 400 trees along with some medicinal plants. I am by profession an IT engineer working with an MNC. But I want to take this up as a full time job. Hopefully, I will achieve my goal.\r\nThen, there were several comments which were suggestive of the fact that the youth cared for quality of education. Their concern for better educational opportunities was amply reflected on the app. S Sriramoju highlighted the importance of education and financing education for the poor. Many comments called for an overhaul of the education system where research and innovation get more prominence. Many comments also called for using National Youth Festival to further the message of education among youth.\r\nThese comments got tremendous support, and there have been many ideas for involvement of voluntary community activities.\r\nModi s message to the youngsters at the National Youth Festival was to go for entrepreneurship to realise their dreams, rather than chasing white collar jobs, change the mindset which holds that only degrees and intellectual superiority counts. Instead, what matters is dignity of labour and having a skilled pool of youngsters which can contribute to nation building.\r\nThough Modi did the talking at the inaugural ceremony of the youth festival, the words belonged to the aspirations of the youth at large, a Modi supporter who attended the meet said.', '3191app1.jpg', '16612app2.jpg', '18765app32.jpg', '23554app4.gif', '30995app5.jpg', 'Active');
